          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Me and the team at Nebulox were tasked with designing a brand new
            product from scratch for an overarching brand consists of multiple
            sub brands and products that provides crypto payment solutions to
            other businesses. There was nothing to work off of in terms of brand
            identity and creative direction, not even a product name.
            <br />
            <br />
            My Role in the team: Visual Designer <br />
            <br />
            Design Team: We started with one lead designer and 1 product
            designer plus myself as the hands-on visual designer, but a little
            bit down the road we borrowed another product designer from another
            product team for couple of sprints in order to speed things up.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dev Team: x6 developers <br />
            <br />
            Product Team: x1 product manager, x1 product lead
          </p>
          <h3>Background and Mission Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Our client decided to build their own cryptocurrency marketplace /
            trading platform that can cater to a wide range of users around the
            globe with hassle free KYC (Know Your Customer) processes and free
            access to the wider crypto community regardless of their location.
            <br />
            <br />
            First module that we were tasked to develop was a crypto payment
            gateway as a standalone product so we can generate revenue in order
            to build the rest of the modules. Crypto payment gateway was set to
            be a B2B product that empowers small to large businesses including
            entrepreneurs, medium and large sized organizations and enterprises
            to accept crypto as their payment method for their products and
            services.
            <br />
            <br />
            Building a brand new product from scratch is always challenging yet
            rewarding at the same time. <br />

            </li>
            <li>Email templates</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            <b>No Vision, No Roadmap</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the biggest challenges we’ve had initially was not having a
            product mission and vision along with any product roadmap so it was
            difficult to align the product design team with the executive
            management. It also made it difficult for us when we were trying to
            get a grasp of the product scope and future requirements. <br />
            <br />
            In order to rectify the situation, I’ve conducted multiple workshops
            with the PM and the product lead regarding product scoping and
            roadmap and we were able to land on a roadmap, vision and mission of
            our new product.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Time Constraints</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Another challenge was the fact that we needed to get things done in
            the shortest time possible.
            <br />
            <br />
            We made a decision to borrow another product designer to get things
            rolling. As designers, we are very familiar with tight deadlines but
            sometimes we have to use some creative problem solving to get the
            result we are after even in terms of the team structure.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Wide Range of User Demographics</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            This product must be easy to use and cater to the needs of both our
            direct clients, meaning businesses (called merchants) and their
            users (called merchant’s customers) which means there’s a wide range
            of users from tech savvy and crypto experts to casuals who just want
            to use crypto for payment purposes.
            <br />
            <br />
            We planned for a design that is inclusive and does a lot of
            hand-holding in our onboarding process, empty states and the way we
            convey important information like transaction fees and network fees
            and decisions like choosing proper network when a merchant or their
            customers transferring money.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Scalability</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            It is crucial yet challenging to stay ahead of the ever changing
            crypto ecosystem as it is very new and there are a lot of things to
            consider and prepare for.
            <br />
            <br />
            We decided to go for a modular design approach in terms of our
            solutions which had an impact on everything we were doing in our day
            to day design activities from building a simple component to more UX
            heavy artifacts and decisions like user flows and information
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the design system we’ve developed for the organization a
            little bit before this, product design team had a structure to lay
            their style guide and components on top of a solid foundation which
            helped us immensely particularly with efficiency, quality and speed.
          </p>
          <h3>Design Process Documentation</h3>
          <p>Design thinking process overview</p>
          <div className={`${styles["design-circles-container"]}`}>
            <div>
              <img src={think_process_img_1} alt="think_proccess_1" />
              <p>
                I usually recommend starting with design thinking process when
                there is a lot of ambiguity and unreliability around the work
                being done. This gives me a flexibility around the solutions and
                decisions that are being made. Design thinking process usually
                starts as a linear process but soon enough it changes to a
                non-linear process which is the intended way of going about
                conceptualization, exploration and implementation of the
                solutions.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src={think_process_img_2} alt="think_proccess_2" />
              <p>
                This approach gave us a direction in terms of our next steps and
                requirements. For starters, we tackled the conceptualization
                phase and preliminary research to understand our users, market
                trends, competitors and then defining the product we are working
                on and the ways it should meet all the needs of our customers.
                Next, we jumped to the exploration phase with ideation and low
                fidelity wireframes and prototyping to validated our solutions
                and lastly we finished with early high fidelity comps and
                prototyping to simulate the real product as much as we can.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src={think_process_img_3} alt="think_proccess_3" />
              <p>
                After initial studies we dug deeper for more insights and more
                refinements and this is the phase where design thinking process
                gets a non-linear form and we went back and forth between our
                low-fi prototyping and empathizing stages in order to make sure
                this is as close as it can get to the ideal product while
                considering all the other tangible and non-tangible factors like
                time constraints and resources, team’s state and remaining task
                tickets on our Jira board.

            <p>
              Due to the static nature of their wallet address, it has been
              misused several times. They explored other gateways and tried one
              for a while, but trust issues and the risk of holding
              cryptocurrency led them to withdraw assets after a few
              transactions. As a small business, their transaction amounts are
              low, and because the transfer fees are fixed regardless of the
              amount, high fees made continued use of the previous gateway
              unsustainable.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Having one wallet address for all transactions leads to misuse
                and financial losses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Human errors make distinguishing real transactions from
                fraudulent ones difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Struggles to convince users to share images of assets, resulting
                in lost customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                High fees from reviewed gateways are not sustainable for
                frequent transfers and conversions.

          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>
            First we had to construct a brand identity for this new product and
            then form a style guide that could enable us to bring our wireframes
            to life.
          </p>
          <h3>Logo Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            These are the ideas that our graphic designer had in mind based on
            the direction we agreed upon, but none of them were memorable enough
            and some of them were designed too literal and in a very descriptive
            way. I believe logo should be memorable more than anything else, not
            necessarily descriptive.
          </p>
          <div className={styles["logo-img-container"]}>
            <img src={logo_img_1} alt="logo-img-1" />
            <img src={logo_img_2} alt="logo-img-2" />
            <img src={logo_img_3} alt="logo-img-3" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to go back and forth with
            our graphic designer to achieve the desired result so I had to
            design the logo myself and these are the final touches I made to the
            logo before I call it a day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Goal was to simplify the logo as much as possible and make it easy
            to be identifiable and memorable. It’s a playful reiteration on the
            composition consisting two circles forming an optical illusion of a
            pipe (referring to a Nebulox as a passageway for all kinds of crypto
            tokens). It also depicts an astronaut helmet from a side angle view.
            This is based on the brand story we devised for Nebulox which is
            merchants’ safe comrade in the crypto galaxy. We finished the
            process by adding our merchants to the composition; symbolized by a
            rectangle next to the logotype signifies our merchants. Nebulox
            should feel like a trusted safe for all businesses. They can do
            business feeling assured all transactions are safe and accessible to
            them at any time.

          <p>
            Luckily we’ve already built our in house design system by the time
            we started working on Nebulox, so we’ve had a good foundation to
            define our style guides. We had access to light mode and dark mode
            without any extra efforts inside Figma and code and also a robust
            design token architecture enabled us to handle all sort of wider
            requirements for web, Android and ios like various modes, contexts
            (LTR,RTL, multi language support etc.) and environments. Here’s a
            snapshot of the style guide I designed for Nebulox.

            activities to categorize different sections of the app. Here’s a

                A UX sitemap is a hierarchical diagram of a website or
                application, that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and
                labeled. If a user flow is like the street view details, the
                sitemap is like the bird’s eye view.

                      You should not impose your own wishes or biases upon the
                      participant during (steps 1–3), but after the initial
                      debrief, you can definitely ask the participant to break
                      up large groups into smaller subgroups. Or to group small
                      groups into larger categories.

            As a part of our design thinking process, we experimented a lot with
            different parts of the app. This process usually goes something like
            wireframing and prototyping, getting insights from user testing and
            key stakeholders’ feedback followed by making amendments and repeat
            to get to a point where we could be certain that users can navigate
            the app efficiently and use different features of the app
            conveniently. Since it was a new app that hadn’t been launched at
            that stage we leaned in towards qualitative studies as we had no
            analytics or quantitative data available to us.

            These are the design deliverables and comps we ended up with at this
            stage and obviously we refine them as we get more data on the app
            usage from qualitative insights and analytics data.{" "}

          <p>These are the modules we are going to tackle next:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Back office user management, roles management, tokens management,
              settings, wallet management
            </li>
            <li>
              Merchant settings, wallet management, sweep feature, transactions
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Now that we’ve launched the MMP version we can conduct quantitative
            research and utilize the data to optimize the experience. This will
            helps us immensely in terms of orchestrating a sublime experience at
            scale.
