            <p>
              I was tasked with building a design system for the organization in
              order to raise the bar in terms of the quality of end-to-end to
              production pipeline of all products from design environment to
              codebase of each application.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              My client was in need of a design system that could support all of
              their products. All design and front-end (web) and Android
              engineering efforts were sporadic, random and without any clear
              direction. There were no standards in place and no particular way
              of tackling tasks and challenges.

            <h3>Executive Management Expectations</h3>
            <p>
              MVP version of the product was planned to deliver the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Brand Identity including name, logo, style guides, UI components
                and patterns
              </li>
              <li>User payment flow</li>
              <li>Authentication (login/register)</li>
              <li>
                Merchant dashboard including a full-fledged “Create a Gateway”
                user flow
              </li>
              <li>
                Static pages including a simple home page and terms and
                conditions
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And the MMP version should’ve included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Back office dashboard including gateway management,
                authentication, merchant management
              </li>
              <li>Merchant manual invoice creation and invoice management</li>
              <li>
                More static pages including cookie policy, invoice landing page
                and privacy policy
              </li>
              <li>Email templates</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <div>
              <h4>Visuals inconsistencies across products</h4>
              <p>
                Without a proper style guides, guidelines, component and pattern
                libraries, visual inconsistencies are inevitable.{" "}
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Not Enough Resources</h4>
              <p>
                Ideally we needed a small team to get the ball rolling but one
                front-end developer was all I had in terms of human resources so
                I had to manage the executive management expectations regarding
                deadlines and timeframes.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Duplicated work efforts</h4>
              <p>
                Different product teams build a lot of the same components and
                similar user flows (e.g. authentication flow, user
                management,...) in their application codebase that can be stored
                in a shared repository so everyone can contribute to a stand
                alone repository outside their application codebase. I’ve
                outlined the contribution model as a part of the design system
                governance model that comes further down this document.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>No Design System Knowledge Across the Organization</h4>
              <p>
                My client never had their own design system so there were no
                legacy system to work off of and everything had to be mapped out
                and developed from scratch. <br />
                <br />I conducted 6 workshop sessions to educate the team and
                management on the fundamentals of design systems and its
                benefits for better cross department alignment and also to build
                a common language among key stakeholders.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Multi-brand, Multi Platform, Multiple Modes and Languages</h4>
              <p>
                Goal was to develop a system that can cater to all of our
                product teams for Web and Android and iOS down the road. My
                approach was to build a tokenized design system that stores all
                design tokens in a tech and platform agnostic format such as
                json or yaml so we could use a design token integration tool
                like Salesforce’s Theo or Style dictionary in order to get
                different builds for different environments and truly have a
                SSOT (single source of truth) for our design tokens. Tokenizing
                the design system, also helped us with supporting multiple modes
                such as light mode, dark mode, high contrast mode and any other
                modes as required plus supporting basically any number of
                languages with their own particular specifications as any of the
                products would’ve required.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Modularity and Scalability</h4>
              <p>
                All solutions should have been implemented with scalability in
                mind for example our token architecture, naming and aliasing
                workflow should support changes in scale or when defining
                scales, it should be carefully implemented as in when to use a
                nominal, interval, ratio or ordinal scales. <br />
                <br />
                We decided to go for a modular design approach in terms of our
                solutions which had an impact on everything we were doing in our
                day to day design activities from building a simple component to
                more UX heavy artifacts and decisions like user flows and
                information architecture.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <div>
              <h4>Being %100 on brand all the time across all products</h4>
              <p>
                This is only possible with a well documented and well maintained
                tokenized design system.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Speed up design and development process</h4>
              <p>
                With a proper design and development infrastructure in place,
                speed and quality of the production pipeline increases
                immensely. With a modular approach and a suitable team structure
                I tried to avert major bottlenecks. This means, product team can
                always maintain a continuous delivery without any delay times
                from design system side.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Design System Concepts</h3>
            <p>
              As my client business and user base expanded and the future plans
              became more clear, we needed to have a structure so we could adapt
              to the market needs and rapid changes as well as being able to
              deliver a better and more consistent experience to our end users.
              In order to do this, we had no choice but to increase the quality
              and the efficiency of our production pipeline by having a closer
              look at our processes and the way we were getting things done.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              For some, it will just be a library of reusable components and
              styles (like a pattern library or a library of reusable UI
              elements). For others, there will be extensive detailed
              documentation of style guides containing rules for good and bad
              practices for building GUI (Graphical User Interface) often
              including code elements. <br />
              <br />
              The truth is that any design system, when you start working on it,
              is useful as much as it needs to be. When the needs change in the
              future, there is no problem with extending it, because a design
              system is never done. It’s a living organism that evolves as the
              product and the team working on it grow and expand their design
              principles.

            <p>
              A Component API is the props of a component. When we design APIs
              at the right level of flexibility we reduce refactors, encourage
              code reuse, and increase UI consistency.

              <h4>Strict Props</h4>
              <p>
                Strict props involves well-defined props. They have input props
                for data, and use callbacks for output:
              </p>
              <pre>{`<Select 
options={[1, 2, 3]}
selectedOption={1}
onSelectedOptionChange={() => /* ... */}
/>`}</pre>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Component Props</h4>
              <p>
                Component props involve a data structure which includes a
                component reference somewhere in that structure:
              </p>
              <pre>{`<Multiselect
options={[
{ title: 1, component: MyOptionComponent, text: "One" }
]}
/>`}</pre>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Compound Components</h4>
              <p>
                Involves defining specific components to be used with a base
                component:
              </p>
              <pre>
                {`<Multiselect
selectedValues={[1, 2]}
onSelectedValuesChange={newValues => /* ... */}/>
<Option optionValue={1}>One</Option>
<Group header="The best numbers">
<Option optionValue={2}>Two</Option>
<Option optionValue={3}>Three</Option>
</Group>
</Multiselect>`}
              </pre>
              <p>{`The <Multiselect /> is the base component while the <Option /> and <Group /> components are the specific components`}</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>How do UI Kits and design systems differ?</h3>
            <p>
              If you want to create internal prototypes or purely visual
              designs, a UI kit is an ideal option. However, if you want
              something that works at a larger scale and works for both
              designers and developers, a design system is a must.

                <h4>Scale</h4>
                <p>
                  Working on a short term project? A UI kit is quick to set-up
                  and will likely work out well for you. After all, if
                  developers aren’t creating more than a few pages or a limited
                  app, the extra development work isn't outweighed by the
                  benefits of a design system. That said if you’re looking for
                  long term projects, or even a project you wish to adapt,
                  expand, or otherwise shape over time, a design system is
                  significantly better. The extra investment at the start will
                  come back in the form of rapid changes and a greater assurance
                  of consistency.

              <div>
                <h4>Multi-Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                  If you want to build across platforms and software, a design
                  system can do that. Its central components can be implemented
                  across apps, websites, and other materials - because there’s
                  only one copy of everything, there’s no need to replicate
                  code. <br />A UI kit, on the other hand, isn’t focused on
                  recalling UI assets with flawless perfection, so some manual
                  adjustments will always be needed.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Rapid changes</h4>
                <p>
                  With an already built and ready to use component library and
                  pattern library, you can craft UIs in the intended environment
                  pretty quickly and also changes will be applied centrally, so
                  you can have changes to all components kept in a different
                  repository and have them update and be propagated throughout
                  the product.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>Rapid prototyping</h4>
                <p>
                  Want to put a visual prototype together quickly? A UI kit can
                  do this, as it’s created for taking visual rules and
                  templates, tweaking them slightly to fit new needs. <br />{" "}
                  That being said, design systems are also great for
                  prototyping. Because internal projects don’t want to spend too
                  much time on visuals, a design system recalls this code and
                  cuts down frontend development significantly.

              <div>
                <h4>Sources of Truth</h4>
                <p>
                  Both design systems and UI kits represent singular sources of
                  truth - however, only design systems ensure developers aren’t
                  able to make mistakes. UI kits require developers to manually
                  implement elements over and over again, which leads to minor
                  mistakes and inconsistencies. With a design system, they
                  simply recall existing elements, so there’s no room for such
                  errors.

                  A central delivery team, responsible for the direction and
                  growth of the system. As consumers scale the centralized team
                  must also scale. Consumers are essentially customers that have
                  a passive engagement with the design system.

                  The central team is lean and responsible for the direction.
                  Growth is pushed to the consumers, who drive the evolution of
                  the system.

              After thorough considerations, I made the decision to form a
              hybrid team structure for my client’s design system team based on
              the context of their organization. There are a lot of factors that
              come to play when it comes to strategic decisions like this and I
              had to take into account the resources, time constraints, budget
              and the roadmap of the design system. This approach helped us with
              the development of the foundational design system to be driven by
              a small contingent of enthusiasts. As the system developed and
              adoption grew, the core team took a strategic role in guiding
              evolution. Through contribution, consumers became the driving
              force for growth including product designers and developers from
              different product teams.

          <div>
            <p>
              First step in our design system journey was to define a style
              guide that could serve all products across the organization. I
              started with an in-depth analysis of successful and well adopted
              design systems of all different sizes and scales. Here is what I
              ended up with, in terms of our style guides.
              <br />
              <br />
              Later on, with the addition of the Figma variables support, we
              were able to easily add most of our design tokens inside our style
              guides files in Figma. Hopefully, with later Figma updates, we can
              migrate rest of our tokens such as typography tokens, elevations
              etc. into Figma as well.

              <h4>Why do we need governance model?</h4>
              <p>
                For a design system to thrive and scale within a larger product
                ecosystem, central system team members can’t make all the
                decisions, design all design, code all code. Instead, a system
                practice must model and foster a federated community, opening
                the door to contributions far and wide starting from within the
                organization and wider community later on.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Let’s define “contribution”</h4>
              <p>
                Contributions taking tangible form are obvious. Completing an
                annotated component design as “ready to code” is a contribution.
                Merging a code fix for a defect is a contribution. Authoring and
                publishing a Do/Don’t guideline is a contribution. All are
                measurable, tangible changes to move a system forward.
                <br />
                Yet, so many people frame softer activities as contributions
                too. Is offering verbal feedback during a design critique a
                “contribution?” Is influencing technical architecture a
                “contribution?” Is attending a meeting and nodding tacit
                agreement a “contribution?” These soft, unmeasurable examples
                are important. They lead to tangible change. However, they
                muddle conversations of contribution. We distinguish untraceable
                collaborative acts as participation, not contribution.

                    components are shared, content-agnostic, and
                    context-agnostic built for maximal reuse. These are the
                    components you see in all the publicly-available design
                    systems in the wild.

                  <p>
                    Recipe components are specific compositions of design system
                    components (for the most part) that are to be consistently
                    used across a product, but aren’t agnostic enough to live in
                    the design system. Some examples: ProductCard, ContactCard,
                    NameField (e.g. a collection of first name, middle initial,
                    last name, suffix), AddressField, and so on. These are
                    valuable, reusable components but may only apply to one
                    product. Recipes are often organisms in atomic design speak.

                  <p>
                    “special snowflakes” are one-off components that are needed
                    to build a product, but don’t really get reused outside of
                    their first use case. When we worked with an airline, there
                    was a Seat component that only really made sense for the
                    “Select your seat” functionality on the website.

            <p>
              iOS and Android mobile apps are certainly some of the more common
              non-web digital products, but there can be a vast array of other
              software interfaces floating around an organization. You may deal
              with airplane seat-back UIs, banking ATM UIs, kiosk UIs, medical
              equipment UIs, scientific equipment UIs, and more. All of these
              UIs come to life somehow, and the technologies that power these
              experiences vary widely (and often frighteningly!). Regardless of
              the specific tech employed for these experiences, the same
              guidance applies: create a dedicated repository for common
              UI-specific code, and deploy that code using some form of software
              registry.

                    provides a unified design language for designers and
                    developers to form a common language in terms of components
                    name, design tokens, semantic versioning, component props
                    and foundational style guides. We understand the critical
                    role that product teams play in bringing our applications to

                    <li>
                      Start your message with the word “Issue-Component”
                      followed by a colon “:”
                    </li>
                    <li>Then add your message directly after the colon</li>
                    <li>Be as specific as you can</li>
                    <li>
                      State the version of the component you are reporting is
                      it’s applicable

                  <p>
                    Product teams’ primary concern is getting work out the door,
                    not to uphold the integrity of the design system. Teams get
                    creative and will find ways of getting things done, which
                    may involve hacking styles, creating a slew of one-off
                    components. This is why it is so incredibly important for
                    the makers of the design system to establish a crystal-clear
                    governance process that helps users understand what to do
                    when:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                      A design system component gets them 90% of the way there,
                      but not 100%

                <p>
                  Teams should default to using the design system’s components
                  to help create new product work. The best case scenario is
                  that a team comes to the library, finds the component they
                  need and finds that it fulfills all their requirements. They
                  plug in the component and carry on with more pressing matters.
                  Hooray for best case scenarios!

                <div>
                  <p>
                    If the team comes to the design system and doesn’t find the
                    component they need, if an existing component doesn’t
                    fulfill all the requirements, or if they’re just not sure if
                    the system has what they need, the first step is for the
                    product team to reach out to the design system team via
                    design system support protocol which means they should
                    contact DS group chat on either Telegram or Zoho cliq. The
                    teams will have a conversation to better understand the
                    issue, and then determine whether or not new work needs to
                    happen. Often the design system team can help guide the
                    product team to an existing solution that meets the
                    requirements. Cheers to constructive conversation!

                      as a mortgage calculator, a super intricate and specific

                      (such as adding a breadcrumbs component or perhaps adding

                  snowflakes to be able to track components and make refactoring
                  into the design system easier down the road). If the teams
                  determine the work is part of the design system, the work will
                  be added to the design system backlog capturing the work to be
                  done. <br />
                  The teams will then prioritize the work to be done. If the
                  work is a snowflake, it’s likely that the product team will
                  own and execute the work. But if it’s design system work, the
                  team who take the lead on the initial explorations depends on
                  a number of factors, including priority, urgency, and
                  available resources.

                post by Nathan Curtis on the topic), a new version of the design
                system is released containing the new work (along with any other
                new work) following the semantic versioning guidelines outlined
                by the system. The design team communicates the new release via
                all appropriate channels (Note: the design system team should
                determine what communication channels are used to publicize a
                new release).

                The product team pulls in the new version of the design system
                into their application environment and tests the new work. If
                questions or bugs emerge, follow the support process to handle
                any questions or issues. If no bugs are found, the work is
                staged for the next release of the application and the new
                component or variation makes its way into the live application!

                <h3>Application-specific components</h3>
                <p>
                  At the heart of a design system is a set of reusable UI
                  components that individual applications pull into their
                  projects. These components help ensure UI consistency and
                  cohesion across products while helping teams launch
                  higher-quality work faster than ever. BUT! It’s quite likely
                  that individual applications contain components that fit the
                  very real needs of a specific application (think calculators,
                  holiday-season parallax hero units, context-specific
                  interactive maps, and so on), but may not be able to be
                  immediately (or ever) abstracted into a generic, reusable
                  component that’s included in the design system. Ethan Marcotte
                  had a great recent article on that topic. It’s important to be
                  thoughtful and deliberate about how to handle changes to the
                  system over time. Formalizing a process for making changes to
                  system is important. and dealing with one-off components
                  should be a part of that process.

                  <p>
                    “Shame” is too strong & negative a word, but maybe it’s
                    something like /one-offs, /app-specific, /departures,
                    /non-design-system-components, or some other clever label.
                    The idea is to standardize where all product teams put their
                    application-specific components.

                    This setup provides quite a few benefits:

                      <li>
                        It makes it easy for the design system team to
                        periodically audit these one-off components to ensure
                        individual applications are properly using the design
                        system, and to look for trends across applications to
                        inform the system’s roadmap.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This setup makes lifting app-specific components out of
                        individual apps and into the design system a lot easier.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It makes replacing app-specific components with design
                        system components a lot easier.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It helps the design system team gauge how
                        robust/comprehensive the design system should be. If
                        each product’s application-specific folder has dozens of
                        presentational components, perhaps that’s an indicator
                        that the system needs to provide more solutions.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This structure gives individual teams to get specific
                        things done without the design system’s roadmap serving
                        as a bottleneck.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    It’s not likely every application will ultimately have an
                    empty “one-offs” folder, but as the system matures the
                    number of custom components should trend downwards. By
                    standardizing the way custom components are handled, even
                    deviations still work with the grain of the system.

                If design system team is frantically trying to keep up with
                every UI-related product decision happening across the
                organization, the team runs from meeting to meeting, captures
                other product teams’ UI needs in their already-crowded backlog,
                and then gets to work implementing those requests. This road
                leads to bottlenecks and burnout. There’s a better way. The
                design system doesn’t have to own, include, or oversee every bit
                of UI across a company’s product landscape. It just needs to
                provide a core set of ingredients—and support/encourage teams to
                build recipes with those ingredients.

                    What are recipes, exactly? As the name suggests, recipes
                    combine ingredients to create UI experiences that are
                    complex, delicious, nutritious. The design system’s core
                    components are the ingredients stocked in the pantry. Other
                    product designers then take those ingredients to create
                    product-specific compositions that meet their product needs.

                    <p>
                      For example Card components should be incredibly basic at
                      the DS component level. They are basically boxes that have
                      slots for a CardHeader, CardBody, and CardFooter. That’s
                      it. Almost every implementation of a Card takes the form
                      of a recipe.

                    <h4>Components can move up and down levels</h4>
                    <p>
                      Something that might begin as a product-specific recipe
                      may become so widely used or needed that moving it down to
                      the more foundational design system level is a good idea.
                      A word of caution: things should move down into the DS
                      level rather than cluttering the design system library
                      with a bunch of too-specific components that have to be
                      weeded out later. Polluting a design system library with a
                      bunch of product-specific components gets noisy and messy.

                    <p>
                      Recipes and snowflakes are better off being managed in

                      most UI work outside the application codebase, creating a
                      separation of concerns. The application codebase can be
                      freed up to focus on business logic and making things tick
                      from a back-end point of view, where UI code is managed as
                      a separate layer.

                      It’s clear that all of these parts, subsystems,
                      conventions, vocabulary, processes, etc becomes a lot to
                      digest all at once. We need to make sure everyone’s had
                      enough time to get their heads around things. It’s ideal
                      to have many conversations early and often about where
                      things should live and how things should be structured.

            <h2>Smart Components Guidelines</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                Smart components are UI components wrapped in logic,
                functionality, or other smarts to make the integration of common
                components and services easier for product developers. Design
                system UI components are intentionally dumb. This is by design!
                In order to be as portable and interoperable as possible, design
                system components (and many recipes) don’t contain business
                logic and aren’t wired up to any backend services; they strictly
                handle a component’s presentation and basic functionality (e.g.
                an accordion opens and closes on click).

                <h3>Introducing Smart Components</h3>
                <p>
                  Dumb components actually need to work eventually! Introducing
                  the smart component layer. If core design system components
                  are strictly front-of-front-end, then smart components
                  introduce the back-of the-front-end. This is is a place where
                  the dumb design system components and recipes get wrapped in
                  logic in order to provide downstream development teams with
                  drop-in, ready-to-use functional components and services.

            <h2>Incentivizing Contribution</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                If power is the main incentive in our organisations, then we can
                think of currency as the systems that teams and individuals can
                use to trade power.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h3>Currency can be something that’s officially recognised</h3>
                <p>
                  For example, exceeding the objectives set out in your
                  performance framework is a form of currency. Your performance
                  over the course of a year surpasses what was expected of you,
                  your line manager records this, and you receive power in the
                  form of a bonus or a pay rise. In theory, at least.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Currency can be unofficial as well</h3>
                <p>
                  Being friends with your boss might be a form of currency. The
                  organisation makes a round of redundancies, and they put in a
                  request for you to be kept safe. Your power is derived from
                  that relationship and results in job security. This kind of
                  currency might even be denounced by your organisation at an
                  official level, but that doesn’t make it less real, or indeed,
                  less valuable.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Organisational currency can range from getting a shout out in
                the monthly all-hands for a piece of work well done, all the way
                through to a promotion to director level. Once we start to
                understand the systems of currency our organisation uses to buy
                and sell power, we have something to barter with. We understand
                how to participate in those systems, and when and how to disrupt
                them.
